FILE INTEGRITY ANTI-CHEAT — MANUAL
=================================

1. PURPOSE
----------

This program verifies file integrity by comparing the current file system
state against a previously saved trusted snapshot (baseline).

It is designed as a foundational anti-cheat / anti-tamper mechanism.


2. CORE CONCEPT
---------------

The engine operates in two phases:

A) BASELINE CREATION
   - All files in the target directory are scanned
   - Each file path and size is recorded
   - Data is saved into "baseline.txt"

B) VERIFICATION
   - Files are scanned again
   - Current data is compared with baseline
   - Differences are reported


3. WHAT IS CHECKED
------------------

✔ File existence
✔ File size integrity

The program reports:
- [MISSING]   → file was deleted
- [MODIFIED]  → file was altered


4. WHAT IS NOT CHECKED
----------------------

✘ File content hashes (yet)
✘ In-memory modifications
✘ Runtime process injection
✘ Kernel-level tampering

This is INTENTIONAL to keep the project minimal and understandable.


5. HOW THIS RELATES TO ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEMS
-----------------------------------------

Real anti-cheat systems use this exact idea as one of several layers:

- File integrity checks (this project)
- Memory validation
- Anti-debugging
- Driver-level monitoring
- Server-side validation

This project represents the FILE-SYSTEM LAYER.


6. COMMON USE CASES
-------------------

- Detect modified game files
- Detect removed executables or DLLs
- Detect cheat loaders placed in directories
- Verify installation integrity
- Early tamper detection


7. SAFE USAGE RULES
-------------------

- Always generate baseline on a clean install
- Do not edit baseline.txt manually
- Store baseline securely
- Do not rely on size-only checks in production


8. EXTENDING THE PROJECT
------------------------

Recommended upgrades:

- Replace file size with SHA-256 hashes
- Add periodic scanning (thread or timer)
- Limit scanning to specific directories
- Add whitelist rules
- Encrypt baseline file


9. IMPORTANT WARNING
--------------------

This project is NOT a full anti-cheat solution.
It is a learning and foundation tool.

Security is about layers, not single checks.


10. FINAL NOTE
--------------

If you understand this project deeply,
you already understand one of the core building blocks
used in real-world protection systems.
